# Data-Scientist-Salary-Bracket-Prediction
This projects focuses on predicting the income brackets of various data scientist profiles listed on an online job portal. The classification models used for this project are Ordinal Logistic Classification and K-Nearest Neighbour models. KNN being a lazy algorithm uses memorizing techniques from train data to obtain a better accuracy. Proper cross-validation techniques are applied to avoid overfitting of the test data.

Machine Learning Algorithms and accuracy obtained:  Ordinal Logistic Classifier (60.86%), K-Nearest Neighbours  (95.54%)

Programming Language: R

Tools and Methodologies Used: Data Pre-processing and Cleaning, Data Transformation, R Studio
